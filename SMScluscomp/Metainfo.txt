Description: 'performs cluster analysis for US companies. The
               six dimentional data set contrains information on the
               assets, sales, market value, profits, cash flow and number
               of employees of 79 US companies. The companies are
               classified according to their type: Communication, Energy,
               Finance, Hi-Tech, Manufacturing, Medical, Other, Retail,
               and Transportation.
               The rescaling is in this case necessary since otherwise we
               observe most of the points concentrated in the lower left 
               corner with the two largest companies (IBM and General 
               Electric) dominating the plot.
               On the transformed data we perform a principal component
               analysis and a cluster analysis employing L1-norm
               (City-Block) and Ward linkage algorithm. Plots of principal
               components and the dendrogram are presented. After extraction
               of 5 clusters, the principal components with the five
               clusters (denoted by different symbols) and nine sectors
               (denoted by different colours) are shown.
               The plot slightly differs from R due to variation in algorithms.'

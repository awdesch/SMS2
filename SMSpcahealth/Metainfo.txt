Name of Quantlet: SMSpcahealth

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Employs the principal component analysis to the 
               US health data set which contains reported numbers of deaths in
               the 50 U.S. states classified according to 7 categories: accident,
               cardiovascular, cancer, pulmonary, pneumonia flu, diabetes, and
               liver. Normalizing the data gives equal importance to each cause
               of death. Not normalizing however, leaves the most prominent role
               to the variables causing largest number of deaths. Correlations
               of the first two PCs with the original variables, the screeplot
               and a scatterplot of the first two principal components are
               are presented.'

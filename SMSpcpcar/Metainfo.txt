Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Computes parallel coordinates plots for multivariate car data. It allows to capture the structure of multivariate data in a 2 dimensional space. Parallel lines indicate a positive relationship between the variables. The full black line marks U.S. cars, the dotted red line marks Japanese cars, and the dashed blue line marks European cars. Variables 7 (trunk space) to 11 (displacement) imply that US cars are larger than European or Japanese cars. The strong intersection of Variable 1 (price) and 2 (mileage) indicates a strong negative relationship between both variables. As relationships between variables are only visible between neighbouring variables other data visualization techniques are recommended.'

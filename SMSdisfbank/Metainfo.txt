Description: 'Computes Fisher's linear discrimination
               function (LDA) either for the 20 bank notes from Exercise 12.6 or
               for a random set of banknotes. The discrimination function
               is then applied to the the entire bank data set. With the 
               linear discrimination function based on the 20 bank notes 
               from Ex. 12.6 only 6 bank notes out of the entire 200 
               are misclassified, which leads to an error rate of 3 percent.'

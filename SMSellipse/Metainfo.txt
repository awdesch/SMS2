Name of Quantlet: SMSellipse

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'computes ellipsoids for varying rho and d. rho
is the direction and correlation parameter lying between -1 and 1. d
is the radius of the ellipsoids. Given a covariance 
structure Sigma, depending on rho, the ellipse function
calculates the cholesky decomposition of Sigma = Q''*Q,
resulting in a upper triangular matrix Q, which in turn
is used for the transformation of the unit circle with
respect to the direction. The shape of the ellipsoids
is in accordance with the correlation parameter rho.'

Keywords: ellipse, correlation, plot, covariance matrix, Cholesky decomposition

Example: 'Ellipsoids for rho = (0.5, -0.75, 0, 0.25) and radius = (4, 4, 4, 1) are plotted.'

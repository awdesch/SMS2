Name of Quantlet: SMSclusbank2

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'performs a PCA and a cluster analysis for 20 randomly chosen bank notes from the swiss bank notes dataset.
Centered principal components as well as cluster analysis employing
single linkage to squared euclidean distance matrix perform
similarly quite well on seperating real from forged bank notes.'

Keywords: 'cluster analysis, distance, euclidean, euclidean norm,linkage, ward, ward algorithm, dendrogram, principal components, PCA, centering, pseudo random numbers, sampling'

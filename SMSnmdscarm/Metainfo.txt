Name of Quantlet: SMSnmdscarm

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Computes the 2D map of 4 cars based on ranks of differences using nonmetric multidimensional scaling. nMDS assumes dissimilarities being monotone function of the Euclidean distances and uses the iterative Shepard-Kruskal algorithm to find a configuration of points in 2D that satisfies this monotonicity.'

Keywords: 'multidimensional scaling, mds, nonmetric, distance, Euclidean, correlation'

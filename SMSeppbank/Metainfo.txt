Description: 'We read the Swiss banknote data and sphere them to run  EPP on them. We select n randomly choosen one  dimensional projections in the six dimensional space of the data. For each set of projected data the Friedman-Tukex-Index is applied to judge the "interestingness" of the projection.
In the graphics we see the estimated densities for  the best (blue) and the worst (red) projections found. Additionally we see a dotplot of the projections.'

Keywords: 'Friedman Tukey index, kernel density estimation, sphere, Epanechnikov, projection pursuit, projection, dimension reduction'

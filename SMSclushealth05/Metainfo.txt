Published in : 'Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions'

Description : 'Performs cluster analysis for US health 2005 data. On the 
transformed data we perform a principal component analysis and a cluster analysis 
employing Eulcidean distance and Ward linkage algorithm. Plots of principal 
components and the dendrogram are presented. After extraction of 4 clusters, 
the principal components with the four clusters (denoted by different colours) are 
shown. The graphs and clustering differs from R due to different algorithms.'

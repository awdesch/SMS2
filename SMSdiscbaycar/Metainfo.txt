Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Demonstrates Bayes discrimination rule for 
               car data set which encloses different variables for the
               three regions, the US, Europe and Japan. Applying the Bayes
               discrimination rule, an apparent error rate (APER) of 0.2838
               is estimated. Obviously, the Bayes discriminant rule leads
               to better results than ML discriminant rule since it
               gives large weights to U.S. cars which constitute more than
               60 percent of the entire data set.'

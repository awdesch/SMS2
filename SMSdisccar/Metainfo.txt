Description: 'Demonstrates the ML discrimination rule for 
               car data set which encloses different variables for the
               three regions, the US, Europe and Japan. The apparent error
               rate (APER), defined as the percentage of misclassified
               observations is (11 + 8 + 2 + 2 + 3 + 5)/79 = 41.89 per cent.
               It seems that the rule is not particularly good since we 
               have less than 60 chance of correct classification. 
               Moreover, this estimate is based on the observations which 
               were used to construct the discriminant rule and it might
               be way too optimistic.'

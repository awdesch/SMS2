Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Computes normalized principal components for US crime data set which consists of the reported number of crimes in the 50 US states in 1985. The crimes were classified according to 7 categories: murder, rape, robbery, assault, burglary, larceny, and auto theft. The data set also contains identification of the resion: Northeast, Midwest, South, West. After scaling the variables, a NPCA is perfomed the reported felonies. A scatterplot of the first two principal components, a screeplot and a plot of the correlations of the first two PCs with the original variables.'

Keywords: 'NPCA, dimension reduction, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, multi-dimensional, multivariate, normalization, pca, principal-components, scaling, screeplot, transformation'

Description: 'Performs a factor analysis on the variables 
               'Length','Height Left','Height Right','Inner Frame Lower',
               'Inner Frame Upper' and 'Diagonal' in the bank data set
               using iterated principal factors method (iPFM)
               with and without manual rotation by an angle of 7*pi/12
               counterclockwise. Estimated factor loadings, communalities
               and specific variances are presented in a table, plots of
               original and rotated factor loadings are given'

Description: ‘Performs a normalized principal component
              analysis for the athletic data set (athletic.mat) which
              contains national athletic records of 55 countries in eight
              disciplines (100m, 200m, 400m, 800m, 1500m, 5km, 10km and
              marathon). Evidently, for different length of tracks
              different times were measured. Thus, the data is normalized
              before running the PC analysis. Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, 
              screeplot, the first three principal components (PCs) and
              the correlation of the first two PCs with the original
              variables are shown as results.'

Keywords: 'NPCA, dimension reduction, eigenvalues, eigenvectors, multi-dimensional, multivariate, normalization, pca, principal-components, scaling, screeplot, transformation'

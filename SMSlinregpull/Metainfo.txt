Description: 'Computes a linear regression of sales (X1) 
on price (X2) from the pullovers data set 
(pullover.rda). It checks for outliers using a rule on
standardized residuals and computes the same model for
the subset of the pullover data without outliers. Both
regression lines are plotted in the same scatterplot,
the outliers are marked as red triangles.'

Description: 'performs a factor analysis on the US crime 
               data set and estimates factor scores. The data set contains
               the reported number of crimes in he 50 states of the USA
               classified according to 7 cateories.
               A table of estimated factor loadings, communalities and 
               specific variances as well as plots of factors and
               factor scores are presented.
               With p-value 0.8257 for the LR test on k=3 factors we
               cannot reject the null hypothesis of 3 factors to be
               included. First factor could
               be as violent assault and murder criminality factor. The
               second factor is strongly related to larceny, burglary and
               rape. The third factor is related to auto theft, robbery
               and burglary.
               The estimated factor scores for the first factor, murder
               and assault, seem to be largest in North Carolina. The 
               second factor suggests that larceny is common mainly in 
               Arizona and California. The third factor, auto theft and 
               robbery, reaches the highest estimated factor scores in New
               York and Massachusetts.'

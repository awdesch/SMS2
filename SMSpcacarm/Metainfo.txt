Description: 'pplies the PCA to the car marks data
               which contains marks of different car
               brands for different objectives, e.g. economy, service, value, 
               price, design, sporty, safety and handling (marks are assigned 
               as 1 = best, 6=worst). Eigenvalues of the covariance
               matrix, the proportion of explained variance are presented.
               Moreover first three principal components are plotted
               against each other, a screeplot is displayed and the
               correlations of the first two PCs with the original
               variables are shown. In addition the hypothesis that the
               proportion of variance explained by the first two PCs is
               85 percent is tested and rejected. Thus the proportion of
               explained variance by the first two PCs is larger than 85.'

Output: 'Eigenvalues, eigenvectors, screeplot, the first three principal
components and the correlation of the first two PCs with 
the original variables are shown as results. Moreover the
hypothesis of variance explained being equal to 85% is
tested.'

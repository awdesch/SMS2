Description: 'performes a linear regression and an analysis
of variance (ANOVA) for three marketing strategies.
A company decides to compare the effect of three marketing strategies:
1. advertisement in local newspaper
2. presence of sales assistant
3. special presentation in shop windows,
on the sales of their portfolio in 30 shops.
The 30 shops were divided into 3 groups of 10 shops.
The sales using the strategies 1, 2, and 3 were
y1 = (9, 11, 10, 12, 7, 11, 12, 10, 11, 13)',
y2 = (10, 15, 11, 15, 15, 13, 7, 15, 13, 10)', and
y3 = (18, 14, 17, 9, 14, 17, 16, 14, 17, 15)', respectively.
A null hypothesis of equality of means of the three groups
is tested. The standard approach of using ANOVA leads to
an F-test. The alternative proposition is to use a
linear factor model using the strategies as regression
variables to build curve that corresponds to the alternative
hypothesis of the ANOVA with three horizontal lines,
each for one strategy. The F-test of testing equality of
the coefficients to zero corresponds to the null of testing
the marketing strategies having no effect.
The output shows rejection of the null hypothesis.

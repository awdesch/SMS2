Description: 'calculates factor scores for the vocabulary 
               data set, which contains the test scores of 64 pupils from
               the eigth through eleventh grade levels. For each pupil we
               have one test score per grade which leads to a
               4-dimensional data set. However, after perfoming LR test,
               we observe, that H0 k=1 factor cannot be rejected at a
               p-value of 0.457. Estimated factor loadings, communalities
               and specific variances are presented in a table. A plot of
               factor scores for the pupils is shown. The values on the 
               vertical axis are randomly chosen so that the plotted
               numbers are readable. The best values were achieved in
               observations 36 and 38 whereas the 5th observation seems
               to be extremely bad.'

Keywords: 'varimax, rotation, factor analysis, factor scores, factor loadings, communalities, specific variances, factor model'

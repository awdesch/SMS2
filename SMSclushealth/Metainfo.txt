Name of Quantlet: SMSclushealth

Published in: Multivariate Statistics: Exercises and Solutions

Description: 'Performs cluster analysis for US health data.
On the transformed data we perform a principal component
analysis and a cluster analysis employing Eulcidean
distance and Ward linkage algorithm. Plots of principal
components and the dendrogram are presented. After extraction
of 4 clusters, the principal components with the four
clusters (denoted by different colours) are shown.
The graphs and clustering differs from R due to different
algorithms.'

Keywords: 'cluster analysis, distance, euclidean, euclidean norm, linkage, ward linkage, dendrogram, principal components, PCA, centering'

Description: 'Performs cluster analysis for US crime data.
               On the transformed data we perform a principal component
               analysis and a cluster analysis employing chi-squared
               distance between rows and Ward linkage algorithm. Plots of principal
               components and the dendrogram are presented. After extraction
               of 5 clusters, the principal components with the five
               clusters (denoted by different colours) are shown.'

Keywords: 'cluster analysis, distance, chi-squared distance, linkage, ward linkage, dendrogram, principal components, PCA, centering, chi-squared'

Description: 'performs a factor analysis on the US health
               data set. The first factor, corresponding to diabetes, 
               cancer, and cardiovascular problems, leads to higher factor
               scores in Rhode Island. On the other side, these causes of
               death are less common mainly in Alaska, Wyoming, Colorado,
               and Utah. The second health factor, positively related to  
               pneumonia flu, has highest estimated values in South Dakota
               and smallest values in Alaska. The third health factor, 
               strongly positively related to liver, has high values in Florida,
               California, and New York and small values in Hawaii and 
               Mississippi. Looking at the the geographical codes, 
               it is interesting to note that Florida seems to be a 
               regional outlier from the point of view of the third factor.
               The most healthy U.S. states are Alaska, Hawaii, and Utah.
               A table of estimated factor loadings, communalities and 
               specific variances as well as plots of factors and
               factor scores are presented.'
